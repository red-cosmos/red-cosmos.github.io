  </h1>
  <p>In the spring of 1896, a paper by a Swedish scientist was published in a
journal based in London. It was titled, &lsquo;On the Influence of Carbonic Acid
in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground&rsquo;. The scientist&rsquo;s name
was Svante Arrhenius. It discussed, at a time when the polio vaccine had
not yet been developed, how increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide gas
(then referred to as &lsquo;carbonic acid&rsquo;) in the atmosphere could lead to a rise
in the average temperature of the earth&rsquo;s surface. He estimated that a 2.5
fold increase in the atmospheric CO₂ concentration would result in an 8-9°C
increase in the temperature of the arctic.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This was one of the first
quantifications of the greenhouse effect and marked the early days of the
climate change awareness movement.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years before Arrhenius&rsquo;s paper, another movement was seeing its
beginnings. After the Prussian army forced the Provisional Government of
Paris &ndash; the same Government that violently massacred protesting Parisians
a few days prior &ndash; to surrender, most of Paris was disarmed. The National
Guard and a large portion of the working class, as they kept their weapons,
restricted the Prussians to only small sections of the city. The National
Assembly, having now moved to Versailles, sent in the army to destroy the
workers&rsquo; movement, but after they refused to carry out their orders and stood
in solidarity with the workers, the Paris Commune was elected by the citizens
of Paris.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A highly democratic enterprise, the Commune weathered two months
of attacks and sporadic attempts at sabotage before being brutally suppressed
by a French army assisted by the Prussians. More than a week was spent by the
army &ndash; the Bloody Week &ndash; murdering workers, shooting civilians on sight.</p>
<p>While, in Europe, the working class was creating revolutionary change, in
Asia, the British Crown, in 1857,  was taking control of India from the East
India Company.  Over the course of the next 90 years, a river of wealth
flowed from Delhi to London.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> India was being deindustrialised, impoverished,
and, to make sure she could never catch up to her former masters, divided on
religious lines. Meanwhile, other European giants were playing different
flavours of the same game in various parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and
South America, taking home the wealth and leaving behind deformed &lsquo;states&rsquo;
with borders drawn at the whim of some military officer. But at the start
of the 20th century, when the behemoth of colonialism was selfishly devouring
most of the world, a new kind of society was born in Russia, one similar
to that of the Communards, but bigger in scope and more resilient in the
face of adversity. After successfully defending the country from a military
intervention by the imperialists,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
would stand tall for 70 years before its untimely dissolution.</p>
<p>As the communists worked their way through a civil war and a world war,
fighting tooth and nail for mere survival, the capitalists were using all the
resources they could get their hands on to enrich themselves while loudly
proclaiming ideals such as equality and freedom.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> As it became more and more
expensive to maintain factories and pay workers in the first world, more and
more of these countries started moving the manufacturing jobs to the global
south, to the &lsquo;developing&rsquo; countries, where they could exploit the cheap
labour, salvage whatever resources were left after decades of being colonies,
and, as a bonus, distance themselves from most of the environmental damage.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
If we carefully look at this process, we can see it for what it really is: the
conversion of a very fragile biosphere, with the help of the labour of the
already impoverished, into chunks of paper called money, or &ndash; just as bad
&ndash; numbers on a few redundant computer harddisks sitting in distributed data
vaults located anywhere from Zurich to Mumbai. And to maintain this process,
the accumulation of capital for the sake of itself, it needs undisrupted
economic growth.</p>
<p>From the daily experience of a human, growth is a welcome phenomenon. Seeds
grow into trees, babies grow into adults. Yet when blood cells develop a
will of their own and begin multiplying indefinitely, it is considered but
a deadly disease. If the world economy grew at a rate of only 5% every year,
its size would have to double every 14 years. In this steady growth scenario,
as much resources would be consumed and as much pollution would result every
14 years as that of all the previous years combined. In other words, we would
consume and pollute as much from 2020 to 2034 as we did in all of modern
history. This is neither healthy, nor sustainable.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The capitalist concept
of economic growth is less like a tree and more like cancer. People long before
Arrhenius have been aware of this, but it has rarely trickled into mainstream
thought because of various factors.</p>
<p>One important factor that keeps anything antithetical to the capitalist
world-view away from the eyes and ears of a large chunk of the population
has been mass media.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Over the years, the pursuit to maximise profit by
any means has, along with the vested interests that control it, made the
media &ndash; radio, television, newspapers, even a large part of online media
&ndash; present to its viewers only the most sensationalist, head-turning,
eye-catching content, while the real social problems are either completely
ignored or deliberately played down. The media has also campaigned both
overtly and subliminally against any and all anti-capitalist &ndash; especially
socialist &ndash; thought and this has led to a situation where the working
masses, even in the face of starvation, will blame each other for their
plight, but never the ruling elite.</p>
<p>The elite, however, a small number of people who hoard most of the world&rsquo;s
wealth, are actively working to maintain the status quo, even in the face of
global calamities &ndash; wildfires, floods, droughts, hurricanes &ndash; which have
their origin in a climate that is slowly changing for the worse. 124 years
after Arrhenius&rsquo;s paper and forty years after the first World Climate
Conference, we are nowhere near keeping greenhouse gas levels low enough
to avoid catastrophic global warming and climate breakdown. Close to the end
of the 20th century, major corporations actively funded research that argued
climate change was either not real, or not as dangerous as it was made to
look.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Public pressure has since reduced such incidents, but corporations
continue to covertly spread climate change denial, while governments continue
to help them burn more and more fossil fuel, the primary source of greenhouse
gases today. If things stay as they are now, which seems likely, global
warming coupled with positive feedback loops will soon result in worldwide
climate disaster in a few decades.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>A very large number of people believe that technology can save us from the
problems we are facing. But this is just wishful thinking. Technology is not
magic. It takes energy to build, operate and maintain technological systems.
At the beginning of the oil boom nearly 150 years ago, the United States, the
then sole producer of oil, produced (a better word would be &lsquo;extracted&rsquo;) only
around 2,000 barrels of oil in a year. By 1906, it had climbed to 2,400
barrels every 10 minutes. Today, the world extracts 2,800 barrels of oil
every 3 seconds.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Not only are we using more oil, we are also using more
oil to extract and process oil itself, as the accessibility and quality of
the black liquid slowly deteriorate. While it may still be viable to switch
to renewables, even if we ignore the fact that the process itself is expected
to use a large amount of oil, meeting the demands of the world economy as it
stands today is virtually impossible, since there is not enough renewable
energy to go around. Further, the infrastructure necessary for such a society
would mean that we would have to overhaul entire systems just to begin the
widespread use of renewables. Diminishing returns on energy, depletion of oil
reserves, dangerous levels of global warming, and difficulties in shifting to
renewables are together creating a predicament of global societal
collapse.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> While some level of collapse is certain, the actions we take
in the immediate future will mean the difference between billions of deaths
and millions.</p>
<p>From ancient history to the Paris Commune, and then on to this very day,
people have fought for self-determination and against unjustified authority.
In a world where freedom and democracy are hollow words thrown around by
imperial powers to justify neocolonialist interventions and destruction of
governments elected by the people, we should be wise enough to not be fooled
by the facade created by mainstream media and the popular narrative. Armed
with the tools of logic, reason and action, we the common people of the world
shall prevail.
Democracy shall prevail.
Justice shall prevail.
Humanity shall prevail.</p>
<p>Long Live the People&rsquo;s Revolution.</p>
